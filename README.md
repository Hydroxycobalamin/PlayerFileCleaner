PlayerFileCleaner
-----------------

PlayerFileCleaner cleans your playerdata in your world folders.

It tries to converts V3 and unknown playerdata to V4 playerdata by calling the Mojangs API.
Optional it can also remove bedrock(Geyser) playerdata, if you want that.

### How to use

1. Download PlayerFileCleaner or build it yourself.
2. Create a .json file which contains the uuids and player names of your players on your server. You can use Denizen and this script to create the file automatically.
3. Start PlayerFileCleaner and select the .json file, the world you want to clean and a output path, where the backups and logs should be stored.

Ideally you create a backup of your server, just in case something goes wrong.
